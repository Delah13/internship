    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Kusiima Denise a 3rd year Software engineering student in Mbarara ,Uganda. I specialize in crafting meaningful digital experiences. During free time, I’m either cooking or reading novels.
        My journey into design starts with my mom, who inspired me with her beautiful drawings. She taught me the art of choosing colors and also guided me  to complete drawing tasks during childhood.
        With a keen eye for fashion and color selection, I ensure everything looks aesthetically pleasing, from digital products to anything I want or see.</p>
